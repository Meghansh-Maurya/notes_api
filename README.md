# 📝 Notes API (FastAPI)

A simple backend Notes API built with **FastAPI**, demonstrating clean API design, modular project structure, and proper request/response validation.

This project was built step-by-step to learn **real backend fundamentals**, not just CRUD syntax.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Create, read, update, and delete notes
* Server-generated unique IDs
* Clear separation of:

  * input models
  * output models
  * routes
  * storage
* Modular FastAPI project structure
* Proper HTTP status codes and error handling

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **FastAPI**
* **Pydantic v2**
* **Uvicorn**

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Activate virtual environment (if not already)

```bash
# Windows
env\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source env/bin/activate
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run the server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Server will start at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 4️⃣ Open API Docs

Visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Use Swagger UI or Postman to test endpoints.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint      | Description       |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| POST   | `/notes`      | Create a new note |
| GET    | `/notes/{id}` | Get a note by ID  |
| PUT    | `/notes/{id}` | Update a note     |
| DELETE | `/notes/{id}` | Delete a note     |

## 📌 Example Request (POST `/notes`)

```json
{
  "title": "My first note",
  "content": "Learning FastAPI"
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "My first note",
  "content": "Learning FastAPI"
}
```

## 🧪 Notes

* Data is stored **in-memory** (no database yet)
* IDs are generated by the server
* Designed to be easily extended with a database later

---

## 📈 Learning Goals Covered

* RESTful API design
* Input vs output data models
* API contracts using `response_model`
* Modular backend structure
* Safe state handling
* Professional Git workflow
